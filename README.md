# Project Title
# AI Ethics - Bias Detection and Mitigation in AI Systems
Project Description
This project is part of an AI Ethics assignment focusing on identifying, auditing, and mitigating algorithmic bias. We conduct a fairness audit on the COMPAS dataset using IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit and analyze real-world case studies where AI systems exhibited bias.
# Project Structure
•	case_studies.md: In-depth analysis of biased AI systems.
•	bias_audit.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook performing the COMPAS dataset audit.
•	visualizations/: Directory containing plots visualizing bias metrics.
•	README.md: This file.
# Key Tools Used
•	AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)
•	Scikit-learn
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
